Module 1 Lab
Before starting the lab, be sure you have chosen a text editor (Brackets, Sublime,
Notepad ++, etc) and have already downloaded it your computer.
The focus of this lab is to get an html document uploaded to your web host
(homepages.uc.edu) and format the link to view the page in your browser. Next week
we'll replace this page with an updated version using proper HTML and CSS techniques.
This assignment is pass/fail. You must revise and resubmit until you "pass".
1. Create and save HTML Document.
a. Be sure to save it as index.html, so that it will automatically show when you
create the link to your homepages.uc.edu sub domain. If you don't name it
index.html, and instead use something like Index.html, INDEX.html, or
home.html it will not display unless you include the file name in your link. As
a best practice you home page for your root file should always be named
index.html
b. To keep your documents organized, you should create a folder on your
computer for THIS class, and subfolders within that folder for each week's
labs/assignments. If you do not, you will have file names that conflict and
accidentally save over previous assignments.
2. Add the following text to you document, using your own name and the current
semester: "Hello World! Welcome to Nikki's IT2040 Portfolio".
a. If you're more advanced, go ahead and format this as a level 1 heading. If
not, we'll do it next week.
3. Log into or create your account for homepages.uc.edu
a. Review the IT@UC knowledge base articles if you do not know how to do this.
4. Use the cPanel interface to upload your index.html file to the public_html folder.
a. Review the optional tutorial below for help.
5. Determine the link that you'll need to use to view your page in browser. Test to
ensure it displays before submitting.
6. Submit the link and a screen shot showing you page displaying in browser.
